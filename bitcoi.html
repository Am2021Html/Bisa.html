	  <p>
	    Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009. It does not rely on a central server to process transactions or store funds. There are a maximum of 2,099,999,997,690,000 bitcoin elements (called satoshis, the unit has been named in collective homage to the original creator), which are currently most commonly measured in units of 100,000,000 known as BTC. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin (BTC) to ever be created.

As of January 2018, it is the most widely used alternative currency,[1][2] now with the total market cap around 250 billion US dollars.[3]

Bitcoin has no central issuer; instead, the peer-to-peer network regulates bitcoins, transactions and issuance according to consensus in network software. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.

Bitcoins are issued to various nodes that verify transactions through computing power; it is established that there will be a limited and scheduled release of no more than BTC 21 million worth of coins, which will be fully issued by the year 2140.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoins as payment. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using Bitcoin.

Internationally, bitcoins can be exchanged and managed through various websites and software along with physical banknotes and coins.[4][5]

	     Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange which is the largest exchange in the world in terms of daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies.[2] It was founded in 2017 and is registered in the Cayman Islands.

Binance was founded by Changpeng Zhao, a developer who had previously created high frequency trading software. Binance was initially based in China, but later moved its headquarters out of China following the Chinese government's increasing regulation of cryptocurrency.

In 2021, Binance was put under investigation by both the United States Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service on allegations of money laundering and tax offenses.[3][4][5] The UK's Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to stop all regulated activity in the United Kingdom in June 2021.[6]

In February 2022, Binance donated $10 million for humanitarian needs in Ukraine amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[7]
History
Exchange
CEO Changpeng Zhao had previously founded Fusion Systems in 2005 in Shanghai; the company built high-frequency trading systems for stockbrokers. In 2013, he joined Blockchain.info as the third member of the cryptocurrency wallet's team. He also worked at OKCoin as CTO for less than a year, a platform for spot trading between fiat and digital assets.[8]

The company was founded in China but moved its servers and headquarters out of China and into Japan in advance of the Chinese government ban on cryptocurrency trading in September 2017.[9]

In January 2018 it was the largest cryptocurrency exchange with a market capitalization of $1.3 billion,[10] a title it has retained as of April 2021, despite competition from Coinbase, among others.[11]

In March 2018, Binance announced its intentions to open an office in Malta after stricter regulations in Japan and China.[12] In April 2018, Binance signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Bermuda.[13] Months later, a similar memorandum was signed with the Malta Stock Exchange to develop a platform for trading security tokens.[14] In 2019, company announced Binance Jersey, an independent entity from its parent Binance.com exchange, with the aim to expand its European influence. Jersey based exchange offers fiat-to-cryptocurrency pairs, including the Euro and the British pound.[15]

In August 2018, Binance along with three other big exchanges raised $32 million for a stablecoin project. The idea of stable coins is to provide a cryptocurrency without the notorious volatility of Bitcoin and other popular digital assets.[16]

In January 2019, Binance announced that it had partnered with Israel-based payment processor Simplex to enable cryptocurrency purchases with debit and credit cards, including Visa and Mastercard. The purchases are subject to Simplex’s local bank policies and are limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple’s XRP.[17]

On 7 May 2019, Binance revealed that it had been the victim of a “large scale security breach” in which hackers had stolen 7,000 Bitcoin worth around U.S.$40 million at the time.[18] Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the hackers “used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks” and structured their transaction “in a way that passed our existing security checks.”[19] Binance halted further withdrawals and deposits but allowed trading to continue. The site pledged to reimburse customers through its "Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU)".[20][21] Withdrawals resumed by 19 May.[22]

In September 2019, the exchange began offering perpetual futures contracts, allowing leverage as high as 125 times the value of the contracts.[23] In November 2019, Binance acquired Indian bitcoin exchange WazirX.[24]

On 21 February 2020, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) issued a public statement responding to media reports referring to Binance as a 'Malta-based' cryptocurrency company. The statement noted that Binance "is not authorized by the MFSA to operate in the cryptocurrency sphere and is therefore not subject to regulatory oversight by the MFSA." The MFSA added that it was "assessing if Binance has any activities in Malta which may not fall within the realm of regulatory oversight."[25]

On 28 October 2020, Forbes staff released leaked documents alleging that Binance and Changpeng Zhao created an elaborate corporate structure designed to intentionally deceive United States regulators and secretly profit from cryptocurrency investors located in the country.[1] Binance officially blocks access from IP addresses located in the United States, but "potential customers would be taught how to evade geographic restrictions", Forbes claimed.[1]

In May 2021 it was reported that Binance was under investigation by both the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Justice on allegations of money laundering and tax offenses.[26][27][28]

In February 2022, Binance took a $200m stake in Forbes.[29]

In March 2022, amidst the Russian invasion on Ukraine, Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao, refused refused to ban the users from Russia, citing "financial freedom."[30]

	    Mining:
		<ul>
		  <p>
		    Shipping your mining gear back to China for repair isn't the best idea, shipping to and from China will cost a lot, or your miner could be "confiscated" by the manufacturer.

I thought there should be a list of good repair services that all miners can access locally based on their geographical location, this will ensure a cheaper shipping rate and a much faster repair process.

I will be updating the list regularly as information come by, if you have or know a repair service please share it here or send it to me via pm, I will try to do some basic research on all the services I list here, but you will deal with them at your own risk.

Inputs coming from trusted members of the mining community in Bitcointalk will be very helpful.
